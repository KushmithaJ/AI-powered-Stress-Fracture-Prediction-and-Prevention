The AI-powered stress fracture prevention and prediction system is designed to analyze risk factors using machine learning techniques like SVM and KNN. It assesses patient data, including activity levels, bone density, and biomechanical risk factors, to predict the likelihood of developing stress fractures. By leveraging predictive analytics, the system enables early detection and personalized prevention strategies, helping individuals modify their routines to reduce injury risks. The project focuses on improving diagnostic accuracy, refining evaluation metrics, and integrating scalable healthcare solutions. Future enhancements include wearable integration, deep learning models, and expanded injury predictions to further optimize injury prevention and management.
